= Testing

The test suite is based on https://mochajs.org/[Mocha] and https://www.chaijs.com/[Chai].

The tests are located in the `spec` folder, and are defined in TypeScript in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development[BDD] style.

== Command Line

Run all the tests with the `npm test` command:

[source]

== Visual Studio Code

Mocha integrates naturally into Visual Studio Code, particularly when using the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-mocha-test-adapter[Mocha Test Explorer] extension. Tests can therefore be run (and debugged) directly in the IDE, either all at once, or in a case-by-base basis.
